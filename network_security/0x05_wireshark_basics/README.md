# Wireshark Basics

## Description

This project introduces the basics of network traffic analysis using **Wireshark**.
The goal is to understand how different network scanning techniques generate
specific types of packets and how to detect them using Wireshark display filters.

Each task focuses on identifying packets generated by **nmap** commands and
writing the appropriate Wireshark filter to capture them.

## Objectives

- Understand how nmap scans generate network traffic
- Learn how to analyze packets with Wireshark
- Write correct Wireshark display filters
- Distinguish between different protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)

## Requirements

- Kali Linux or similar environment
- Wireshark
- nmap
- Basic knowledge of networking protocols

## Files

- `0-ip_scan.txt` : Wireshark filter to detect packets generated by an IP protocol scan (`nmap -sO`)

## Usage

The filters provided in this project are meant to be used directly in the
Wireshark **Display Filter** bar.

They are not shell commands and should not be executed in a terminal.
